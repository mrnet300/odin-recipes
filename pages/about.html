        <p>Turkey may be famous for its kebabs, but the popular dish is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to
            Turkish cuisine.</p>
        <p>Covering over 300,000 square miles, the European destination's rich and diverse food is largely thanks to its
            landscape.
            Plateaus and plains of fertile soil formed by now extinct volcanoes, snow-covered mountains and fast-flowing
            rivers lend themselves to a rich and varied table.
            This includes olive oil based dishes from the Mediterranean Coast, hearty pastries from central Anatolia,
            subtle spicy flavors from the east and southeast, and that's just for starters.</p>
        <p>Traditional Turkish foods rely less on seasonings and more on tasty fresh ingredients rolled, kneaded, shaped
            and cooked to perfection with care, dedication and passion.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Turks love their food so much they even write songs about it -- "Domates, biber, patlican" by
            Anatolian rock star Baris Manco translates to "Tomatoes, pepper, eggplant."</p>
